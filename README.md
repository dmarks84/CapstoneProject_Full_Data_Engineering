## Project(CapstoneProject_Full_Data_Engineering)
### Part of the Coursera series: IBM Data Engineering & Python
    
## Summary
In this project, I applied all of the skills and knowledge gained during the courses leading up to it.   We were tasked with taking in OLTP data via reading a .csv file as well as querying a SQL (MySQL) database.  This data was then exported for additional querying and manipulatoin in a NoSQL database (MongoDB).  We then agglomerated the data in a datawarehoues and performed addional SQL queries and manipulation, this time using PostgreSQL.  On the data, we created some visualizations before setting up a pipeline to handle automation of ETL going forward,  and we ended the project by developing an automated process to create a machine learning model to predict future behavior.
